# Kotlin Only Rule

- Do not create, add, or commit any files with the `.java` extension in this project.
- All new source code files must use the `.kt` extension and follow Kotlin conventions--code should be as idiomatic as possible within reason.
- If code is to be ported or added, it must be in Kotlin, not Java.
- All test files must also be written in Kotlin.
- If a request is made to add Java code, suggest Kotlin instead and reference this rule.

_This rule is enforced by the project maintainers and the AI assistant. Any violation should be corrected immediately._
